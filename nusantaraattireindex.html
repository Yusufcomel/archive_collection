       <h2>What is Nusantara?</h2>
<p>“Nusantara” is a term that refers to the vast Malay Archipelago a cultural and geographical region that includes modern-day Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Southern Thailand, and parts of the Philippines. Rooted in the Sanskrit words *nusa* (island) and *antara* (between), it represents a shared heritage of island communities linked by trade, language, traditions, and maritime culture.</p>

<p>In the context of Nusantara Attire, “Nusantara” highlights the deep historical and cultural connections across this region, especially in how traditional clothing, such as baju kurung, baju kebaya, and kain songket, reflects a common identity shaped by centuries of cultural exchange and artistic expression.</p>

<h2>Archiving Matter</h2>
<p>Archiving is more than just storing information, it’s about safeguarding our heritage, culture, and identity for the future. In a rapidly changing digital age, traditions like Baju Kurung, Baju Kebaya, and Kain Songket risk being forgotten or lost. By digitally preserving these cultural artifacts, we ensure that their stories, values, and beauty remain accessible to future generations.</p>

<p>Nusantara Attire uses web archiving as a powerful tool to document, organize, and protect traditional Malay clothing across online platforms. From historical articles and fashion blogs to community stories, every preserved page is a step toward cultural continuity.</p>

<p>Through archiving, we celebrate who we are, and we give others the chance to learn, appreciate, and carry forward our legacy.</p>
